What Stronghold will have at the end...
---------------------------------------

Stronghold will become a busy 'city' where many people will be living and working there to help Stronghold become a bigger city. Stronghold represents a small county where people are loyal to it and will die fighting for their own 'county'. 
Every x days will attract a random number of newcomers to live in Stronghold.
A basic commoner life is as follows:
- born to two commoners
- work in commoner career
- earning enough to buy food and basic necessity goods for survival.
- live in very basic housing


every once in a while a 'talented' commoner will be born and will break the rules of the commoner and advance above the commoner class.

Feudal class
------------
Commoners
Talented Commoners / Less nobles
Nobles
Royals
Stronghold leader

Commoners - 'slaves' of Stronghold. The ones doing the dirty work.
Talented commoners / Less nobles - Attributed characters that can improve attributes which opens more options for character's life (player starts here). Participate in same class battles only. Top fighters have chance to become noble - must have minimum noble fame requirement.
Nobles - more job oppurtunities, more money to buy more equipment.
Royals - high leveled / famed characters that run the stronghold
Stronghold leader - boss of all. controls and directs Stronghold to which direction it will evolve.


The leader of Stronghold is responsible for all the activites in Stronghold:
- internal (people, living standards, etc.)
- army (readiness, supplies, skill)
- economy (trading, standard of living, prices)

As time goes along, guilds will slowly form when there are enough of people of the same class and have enough money to do so.

All transactions done in Stronghold are taxed.

Food produced in farms at the end of the day are transferred to the granary for storing. Granary is storage to hold food only. Commoners with 0 food may come and purchase from Granary food and money goes to Stronghold Treasury.

Each building needs to have maintenance cost and has degradation.

New buildings:
- stables for horses
- armorsmith
- weaponsmith
- magic shop
- temple for healing and prayers
- guilds
- inns (an improved hut?)
- heavy weapons (catapults , seige weapons for against other strongholds)
- 

At start of the game, stronghold creates constructor jobs to build buildings. Based on number of constructors per building determines how fast the building will be built (limited amount of constructors per building)

Professions gain experience as they work and productivity increases.

Add raw materials later for building requirements.
